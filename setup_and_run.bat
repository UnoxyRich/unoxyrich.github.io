REM with the correct Python code or download them. This batch script cannot
REM reliably create complex Python files with specific content.

REM Example: Create dummy files if they don't exist (replace with your actual code)
REM You should have these files already if you followed previous steps.

REM create app.py, logic.py, data_utils.py and paste the correct code into them.
